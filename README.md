## About the Project

This project is a clone of the Spotify web player, designed to closely mimic the look and feel of the official Spotify app. It features a modern, responsive user interface built using HTML and CSS. The layout includes a sidebar for navigation, a main content area for playlists and charts, and a music player bar at the bottom, providing a realistic Spotify-like experience for learning and demonstration purposes.
